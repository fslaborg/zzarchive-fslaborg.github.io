FsLab _Download a template or get a package_
============================================

Getting FsLab is easy! You can download a template or use Paket or NuGet package:

 - **Download a template.** Get a template from GitHub with all the setup you need
 - **NuGet package.** FsLab is available on NuGet and you can use Paket for best experience

Download a template
-------------------

The easiest way to get started is to copy one of the templates that are
from the [FsLab templates](http://github.com/fslaborg/FsLab)
repository. The templates work with Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio and other
F# editors.

<div style="margin:25px 0px 45px 15px">
<a href="https://github.com/fslaborg/FsLab/archive/basic.zip" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">
  <strong>FsLab basic template</strong></a>
<a href="https://github.com/fslaborg/FsLab/archive/journal.zip" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">
  <strong>FsLab journal template</strong></a>
</div>

### Using the templates

The templates use [Paket](http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket) for dependency management.
When you use the templates, you'll need to run Paket to get the dependencies.
This happens automatically when you build the project, but you can also do it by hand.

 - In the basic template, run [`paket install`](http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/paket-install.html).
   For example, when using mono on Mac, run:

        mono .paket/paket.exe install

 - In the journal template you can use build scripts `build.sh` and `build.cmd`.
   The following will process all journals and open them in a web browser:

        chmod +x build.sh
        ./build.sh run

This downloads the packages and creates `paket.lock` file with the version information.
Once the packages are downloaded, you can open the `Tutorial.fsx` script and edit it.
The tempalates are designed to be used from F# Interactive. Select a couple of lines
of code and use "Alt+Enter" (in Visual Studio), "Ctrl+Enter" (in Xamarin Studio) or
other command to send the code to F# Interactive.

### FsLab Basic template

The basic FsLab template is a minimal sample containing a tutorial and Paket references
as described above. The template works with Xamarin Studio, Visual Studio or via command line.

 - Download [FsLab basic template](https://github.com/fslaborg/FsLab/archive/basic.zip)

### FsLab Journal template

The FsLab Journal template contains everything as described above, but also adds the
ability to generate HTML and LaTeX reports from your literate scripts.

 - Download [FsLab Journal template](https://github.com/fslaborg/FsLab/archive/journal.zip)
 - Install [Visual Studio template](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/45373b36-2a4c-4b6a-b427-93c7a8effddb)

The template comes with build scripts `build.sh` and `build.cmd` that can be used
as follows:

 - `build run` generates HTML outputs, opens them in a browser and automatically
    updates them when the source files change
 - `build latex` generates LaTeX output
 - `build pdf` generates LaTeX and also invokes `pdflatex`

Reference a package
-------------------

It is equally easy to install FsLab using NuGet or using Paket. We recommend
using [Paket](http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket). This is a bit more work at
the beginning, but it will save you time when updating to new versions later!

<div style="margin:25px 0px 45px 15px">
<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsLab/" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">
  <strong>View FsLab on NuGet</strong></a>
  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsLab/" class="btn btn-primary" role="button">
    <strong>FsLab.Runner on NuGet</strong></a>
</div>

### Referencing FsLab using NuGet

FsLab is [available on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsLab/) as `FsLab`.
The `FsLab.Runner` package can be used to re-implement the functionality of the
FsLab Journal template.

To use it directly, create a new project (F# Tutorial is a good start in Visual
Studio and Xamarin Studio). Then add refernece to the FsLab NuGet package and
wait until all components are downloaded.

Finally add a new script file, say `Tutorial.fsx` and load `FsLab.fsx` using the
following command (the version will differ, so you'll have to check the created
`packages` directory; when the project is in a sub-folder you'll also need
to use `../packages`).
*)
#load "packages/FsLab/FsLab.fsx"
open FsLab

### Referencing FsLab using Paket

When referencing FsLab using Paket, you'll need to [download the latest version of
Paket](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/releases/latest) and create a file called
`paket.dependencies` with the following contents:

    [lang=text]
    source https://nuget.org/api/v2

    nuget FsLab

This specifies that Paket should install the `FsLab` package for you. Then
run the following command (drop `mono` on Windows):

    [lang=text]
    mono paket.exe install

The typical usage is to put `paket.exe` into a sub-folder called `.paket`, but this
is completely up to you. Paket will drop the version numbers from folder names, so
you can reference FsLab as follows in your scripts:
*)
#load "packages/FsLab/FsLab.fsx"
open FsLab
(**
This creates `paket.lock` file with the information about installed versions.
Paket makes it easy to update to the latest version of FsLab. Just run `paket update`.
